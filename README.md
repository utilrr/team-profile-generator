# team-profile-generator

## Description of Project
This is a command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

## Aims/Goals
1. Given a command-line application that accepts user input, when I'm prompted for my team members and their information an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input.
2. When I click on an email address in the HTML then my default email program opens and populates the `To:` field of the email with the address.
3. When I click on the GitHub username then that GitHub profile opens in a new tab.
4. When I start the application then I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.
5. When I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number then I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team.
6. When I select the engineer option then I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu.
7. When I select the intern option then I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu.
8. When I decide to finish building my team then I exit the application, and the HTML is generated.

## Installation
You need to clone the code into your own directory, install & require `npm Inquirer` and `FS` &  execute the program in the integrated terminal by typing `node index.js`.

Entering `npm run test` will run all of the installed tests.

## Usage
Start by running `node index.js` in the terminal and just follow the instructions. After you are done, an HTML page will be created that contains your data.

## Challenges Faced
The usual ones: time management issues due to outside distractions, problem solving/debugging of code, fixing tests, too many friends dying (seriously, it's getting ridiculous)
